NAME
    Module::CoreList - what modules shipped with versions of perl

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::CoreList;

     print $Module::CoreList::version{5.00503}{CPAN}; # prints 1.48

     print Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec');       # prints 5.00503
     print Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec', 0.82); # prints 5.006001

DESCRIPTION
    Module::CoreList contains the hash of hashes %Module::CoreList::version,
    this is keyed on perl version as indicated in $]. The second level hash
    is module => version pairs.

    Note, it is possible for the version of a module to be unspecified,
    whereby the value is undef, so use "exists $version{$foo}{$bar}" if
    that's what you're testing for.

    It also contains %Module::CoreList::released hash, which has ISO
    formatted versions of the release dates, as gleaned from perlhist

CAVEATS
    Module::CoreList currently only covers the 5.003_07, 5.004, 5.004)05,
    5.005, 5.005_03, 5.6.0, 5.6.1, 5.7.3 and 5.8.0 releases of perl. Probing
    this information can be rather time consuming so patches are welcomed
    for earlier versions.

HISTORY
    1.6 19th July 2002
        Included Config as a shipped module for all releases of perl (caught
        by Mark Fowler)

        Added data for the 5.8 release.

    1.5 2nd April 2002
        Fixed a glaring bug caught by the testsuite but sadly released.
        perl5.004_05 was released post 5.005_03 and so isn't the first
        release to contain File::Spec.

        Added data for 5.003_07, 5.004, and 5.005 releases.

        Added the %released hash.

    1.4 2nd April 2002
        Bugfixes from Roland Bauer to allow the code to work under 5.004_04.

        Using a cgi developed by Roland caught and fixed a number of bugs in
        the previous extraction of module names.

        Rewrote the name extractor to be simpler.

        Added data for the 5.004_05 and 5.6.0 releases of perl.

    1.3 25th March 2002.
        Initial CPAN release, covers 5.00503, 5.6.1 and 5.7.3
