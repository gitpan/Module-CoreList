NAME
    Module::CoreList - what modules shipped with versions of perl

SYNOPSIS
     use Module::CoreList;

     print $Module::CoreList::version{5.00503}{CPAN}; # prints 1.48

     print Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec');       # prints 5.00503
     print Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec', 0.82); # prints 5.006001

DESCRIPTION
    Module::CoreList contains the hash of hashes %Module::CoreList::version,
    this is keyed on perl version as indicated in $]. The second level hash
    is module => version pairs.

    Note, it is possible for the version of a module to be unspecified,
    whereby the value is undef, so use "exists $version{$foo}{$bar}" if
    that's what you're testing for.

CAVEATS
    Module::CoreList currently only covers the 5.00405, 5.00503, 5.6.0,
    5.6.1 and 5.7.3 releases of perl. Probing this information can be rather
    time consuming so patches are welcomed for earlier versions.

HISTORY
    1.4 2nd April 2002
        Bugfixes from Roland Bauer to allow the code to work under 5.004_04.

        Using a cgi developed by Roland caught and fixed a number of bugs in
        the previous extraction of module names.

        Rewrote the name extractor to be simpler.

        Added data for the 5.004_05 and 5.6.0 releases of perl.

    1.3 25th March 2002.
        Initial CPAN release, covers 5.00503, 5.6.1 and 5.7.3
